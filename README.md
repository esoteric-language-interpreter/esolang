# Esoteric Language Interpreter

**_An esoteric programming language (esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of programming language design, sometimes seen as software
art, other times as a joke._** 

This project was an extension for the ARM Emulator and Assembler for Imperial College London's [CO120.3 Programming in C](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/120_3/). We explored the idea of Turing completeness in programming languages by writing interpreters for esoteric languages. We implemented interpreters for:

**[Brainfuck(BF)](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) - Arjun**

**[Chef](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chef) - Arjun and Clara**

**[Arnoldc](https://esolangs.org/wiki/ArnoldC) - Guljahon**

**[Integ](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Integ) - Azhara**
